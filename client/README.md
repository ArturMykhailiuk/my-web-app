# Client-Side React Application

This is the client-side of the web application built using React. Below are the key components and how to run the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the client-side application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-web-app/client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: The main React component that defines the structure and logic of the application.
  - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application that renders the `App` component.

- `public/`: Contains static files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file where the React app is mounted.

## Build

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized application for deployment.
